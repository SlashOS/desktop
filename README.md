# Hello there!

mkarchiso -v -r -w slashostmp -o slashosout slashoslive

maybe, it's better to include gnome? How will we do that, without changing to much stuff, but it just launching right up, no login anything just directly luanchiung :)

why does someone else have gdm
right now, i'm copy'in g the iso file from my school pc to this bigga pc, to test it, sounds exctiting e: )

TODO:
enable gdm
fix autologin
create systemctl with desktop-installer
